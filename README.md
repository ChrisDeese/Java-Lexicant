How To Play
=============
The game will prompt you for a name and difficulty level. After that, the game
begins with either you playing a letter or the computer playing a letter. The
gameplay works by alternating between the player adding a letter and the
computer adding a letter. When it is your turn, you must type the entire string
you wish to create. For example, if the current string is "CL", sample input
would be
    CLU
if you wished to add the letter U to the end of the string.

In order to win the game, you must either make the computer play a word longer
than 3 characters or bluff you by playing a letter that makes the current string
not a string found in any valid word.
